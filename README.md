# Weather-Analysis-and-Forecasting

# 🔍 Step 1: Data Collection:
I gathered a dataset containing historical weather data including date/time, temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, and weather descriptions.

# The Weather Dataset Description:
The Weather Dataset is a time-series dataset with per-hour information about the weather condition at a particular location.
It records Temperature, dew Point temperature, Relative humidity, Wind speed, Visibility, Pressure and conditions. (Source: Kaggle)

# 🔍Step 2: Data Preprocessing:
After carefully cleaning and preprocessing the data, I prepared it for model training.

# 🔬 Step 3: Feature Selection and Engineering: 
Based on insights gained from EDA, I selected relevant features and engineered new ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.

# ⚙️ Step 4: Model Selection and Training: 
After evaluating on various machine learning algorithms, I chose to implement a Gradient Boosting Classifier due to its high accuracy. I trained the model on the preprocessed dataset.

# ⚙️ Step 5: Hyperparameter Tuning : 
Used GridSearchCV which involves searching for the optimal combination of hyperparameters that maximize the performance of the classifier. 

# 📊 Step 6: Model Evaluation and Validation: I assessed the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics to gauge its accuracy and reliability. It is validated on the test dataset.

# 🚀 Step 7: Deployment : With the model successfully trained and validated, I deployed it using Flask API.
